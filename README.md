# Benchmarks

## Allocation Benchmark

For diagnosing a chromium bug: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1294262#c11

## Deployment

Due to vercel lacking clang (and xz to extract a prebuilt clang), there is a manual deployment stage :(

## Contributing

Interested in contributing? For convenience there is a Dev Container ([see tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers#_installation)), otherwise you'll want Node, Rust, wasm-pack, and clang installed.
